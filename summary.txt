‚ÄúAutomated CI/CD Pipeline for Java Web App Deployment with Monitoring Integration‚Äù
üë®‚Äçüíª Project Overview
This project focuses on deploying a Java-based BoardGame web application using DevOps practices, particularly:

Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

Deployment on AWS EC2 instance

Containerization with Docker

Real-time system and application monitoring

üö® Problem Statement
Manual deployment is:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Hard to scale

Solution: Automate deployment and implement robust monitoring for improved reliability and scalability.

üéØ Objectives
Automate deployment using GitHub Actions

Host application on AWS EC2 using Docker

Monitor system using Node Exporter + Prometheus

Monitor application availability via Blackbox Exporter

Send real-time alerts using Alertmanager (email)

Apply full DevOps lifecycle for production-readiness

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
GitHub (code versioning & CI/CD triggers)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflow automation)

Docker (containerization)

AWS EC2 (hosting infrastructure)

Maven (Java build tool)

Prometheus, Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, Alertmanager (monitoring & alerting)

üîß CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
GitHub repo stores Java app code

GitHub Actions workflow triggers on main branch push

Workflow connects to AWS EC2 via SSH

EC2 instance:

Pulls code

Builds app using mvn clean install

Runs app using Docker

Application becomes live at EC2_IP:8080

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges
Not explicitly listed in the slides, but typically includes:

Setting up secure SSH connections

Docker configuration issues

Monitoring tool integrations

Handling deployment errors

‚úÖ Conclusion
The project successfully:

Implements a complete DevOps pipeline

Achieves automation, observability, reliability, and scalability

Demonstrates real-world use of open-source tools in cloud-based environments

If you want a redesigned version or a one-pager abstract for submission, I can generate that too.
